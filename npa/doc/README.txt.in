@PACKAGE_NAME@

:Author:
    `Frank Morgner <morgner@informatik.hu-berlin.de>`_
:License:
    GPL version 3
:Tested Platforms:
    - Windows
    - Linux (Debian, Ubuntu, OpenMoko)
:Potential Platforms:
    Unix-like operating systems (Mac OS, Solaris, BSD, ...)

The @PACKAGE_NAME@ offers an easy to use API for the new German identity card
(neuer Personalausweis, nPA). The library also implements secure messaging,
which could also be used for other cards. The included |npa-tool| can
be used for PIN management or to send APDUs inside a secure channel.

The @PACKAGE_NAME@ is implemented using OpenPACE_ and OpenSC_. @PACKAGE_NAME@
implements and initializes Secure Messaging wrappers of OpenSC to allow a
transparent SM usage in OpenSC. This allows @PACKAGE_NAME@ to be fully
compatible with OpenSC.

.. include:: autotools.txt

The @PACKAGE_NAME@ has the following dependencies:

- OpenPACE_
- OpenSC_
- OpenSSL_


====================================
Installation of OpenPACE and OpenSSL
====================================

The @PACKAGE_NAME@ links against OpenSSL, which must be patched for OpenPACE.
Here is an example of how to get the standard installation of OpenPACE (with
the required binaries for OpenSSL)::
 
    PREFIX=/tmp/install
    OPENPACE=openpace
    git clone git://openpace.git.sourceforge.net/gitroot/openpace $OPENPACE
    cd $OPENPACE
    autoreconf --verbose --install
    # with `--enable-openssl-install` OpenSSL will be downloaded and installed along with OpenPACE
    ./configure --enable-openssl-install --prefix=$PREFIX
    make install && cd -

The file :file:`libcrypto.pc` should be located in ``$INSTALL/lib/pkgconfig``.


======================
Installation of OpenSC
======================

The @PACKAGE_NAME@ needs the OpenSC components to be installed (especially
:file:`libopensc.so`). Here is an example of how to get a suitable installation
of OpenSC::

    VSMARTCARD=vsmartcard
    git clone git://vsmartcard.git.sourceforge.net/gitroot/vsmartcard $VSMARTCARD
    cd $VSMARTCARD/npa/src/opensc
    autoreconf --verbose --install
    # adding PKG_CONFIG_PATH here lets OpenSC use the patched OpenSSL
    ./configure --prefix=$PREFIX PKG_CONFIG_PATH=$PREFIX/lib/pkgconfig --enable-sm
    make install && cd -

Now :file:`libopensc.so` should be located in ``$PREFIX/lib``.


================================================================================
Installation of the @PACKAGE_NAME@
================================================================================

To complete this step-by-step guide, here is how to install @PACKAGE_NAME@::

    cd $VSMARTCARD/npa
    autoreconf --verbose --install
    ./configure --prefix=$PREFIX PKG_CONFIG_PATH=$PREFIX/lib/pkgconfig OPENSC_LIBS="-L$PREFIX/lib -lopensc -lcrypto"
    make install && cd -



.. _npa-usage:

=====
Usage
=====

The API to libnpa is documented in :ref:`npa-api`. It includes a simple
programming example. Here we will focus on the command line interface to the
library offered by the |npa-tool|. It can perform |EAC| (i.e. |PACE|, |TA|,
|CA|) and read data groups from the identity card.

To pass a secret to |npa-tool| for |PACE|, command line parameters or
environment variables can be used. If the smart card reader supports |PACE|,
its PIN pad is used. If none of these options apply, |npa-tool| will show a
password prompt.

The certificates certificate chain for |TA| should be passed in the correct
order (finishing with the terminal certificate) so that the card can verify it.
|CA| is always done when the terminal's signature has been verified
successfully. The appropriate |CSCA| certificate will automatically be looked
up by OpenPACE.

|npa-tool| can send arbitrary APDUs to the nPA in the secure channel (after
|PACE| or |EAC|).  APDUs are entered interactively or through a file.  APDUs
are formatted in hex (upper or lower case) with an optional colon to separate
the bytes. Example APDUs can be found in :file:`apdus`.

----------------------
Linking against libnpa
----------------------

Following the section Installation_ above, you have installed OpenSSL,
OpenPACE, OpenSC and the @PACKAGE_NAME@ to `$PREFIX` which points to
:file:`/tmp/install`. To compile a program using @PACKAGE_NAME@ you also need
the OpenSC header files, which are located in
:file:`$VSMARTCARD/npa/src/opensc` Here is how to compile an external program
with these libraries::

    PKG_CONFIG_PATH=$PREFIX/lib/pkgconfig
    cc example.c -I$VSMARTCARD/npa/src/opensc \
        $(pkg-config --cflags --libs npa)

Alternatively you can specify libraries and flags by hand::

    cc example.c -I$VSMARTCARD/npa/src/opensc \
        -I$PREFIX/include \
        -L$PREFIX/lib -lnpa -lopensc -lcrypto"
