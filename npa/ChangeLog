	* fixed class byte generation for sm apdu

2010-05-20 18:26  frankmorgner

	* - sm_transmit_apdu doesn't check SWs anymore
	  - not throwing error for sw=63XX in mse:set at

2010-05-20 08:17  frankmorgner

	* - using short apdus for mse:set at and generic authenticate. to
	  make it work with the sm implementation
	  - added parameter oldpacectx to EstablishPACEChannel to allow a a
	  new PACE connection inside an exitsting PACE connection (the
	  output buffer of the latter connection must be provided since it
	  stores the ef.cardaccess)
	  - added functionality to ask for the secret in
	  pace_reset_retry_counter
	  - added macro pace_change_pin
	  - SWs were stored at the wrong place of the output buffer from
	  EstablishPACEChannel, fixed.
	  - split up functionality of pace_test into multiple functions
	  - added new command line option to pace-tool to resume the pin.
	  resuming the pin is not working, yet.

2010-05-18 11:39  oepen

	* Changed EXPLICIT tagging of CHAT and auxiliary authenticated data
	  to IMPLICIT tagging

2010-05-16 18:53  frankmorgner

	* - Added handling for output buffer of EstablishPACEChannel, but
	  CARs are still missing

2010-05-07 11:50  frankmorgner

	* fixed include in pace.c. switched to autotools

2010-05-05 14:38  frankmorgner

	* split up utils into stuff for program and sc handling

2010-05-04 21:01  frankmorgner

	* cleaned up pace.c and moved test_pace to pace-tool.c

2010-05-04 20:16  frankmorgner

	* openpace is now a hard dependancy for pace-tool. ccid does not
	  yet depend on pace, since the USB interface to pace is not yet
	  defined.

2010-05-04 20:03  frankmorgner

	* cleaned up command line options of pace-tool and made it
	  independant from ccid

2010-05-04 08:07  frankmorgner

	* bugfix: initializing apdu in pace_gen_auth. bin_log now checks
	  input data.

2010-05-04 07:57  frankmorgner

	* changed length of read binary apdu to support acr 122

2010-05-03 19:52  frankmorgner

	* put static pace functionality into the new program pace-tool

2010-05-03 13:46  frankmorgner

	* the number of remaining retries is a warning from the card, not a
	  fatal error

2010-04-29 07:33  frankmorgner

	* using proper type for getline result

2010-04-28 13:14  frankmorgner

	* added support for changing CAN and PIN for PACE

2010-04-27 20:02  frankmorgner

	* updated instructions

2010-04-27 20:00  frankmorgner

	* - sm will yield error when the class byte indicates a sm apdu and
	  pace will
	  simply transmit the apdu without encrypting/authenticating it.
	  - fixed building process when compiling without pace

	* added option to scan for available readers

2010-04-15 20:03  frankmorgner

	* added header file for pace library functions

2010-04-15 18:37  frankmorgner

	* - added information about opensc
	  - using sc_transmit_apdu instead of my_transmit_apdu. fixing the
	  opensc error
	  is the better solution than implementing it twice (see
	  http://www.opensc-project.org/opensc/ticket/209)

2010-04-15 07:41  frankmorgner

	* updated information

2010-04-15 07:37  frankmorgner

	* - Fixed error when testing pace without card
	  - Testing pace allows now to choose the type of the secret (mrz,
	  pin, can, puk).
	  The secret can be given as commandline option or interactively.
	  - Cleaned prompt for getting the password
	  - Fixed error when inserting an empty password
	  - When PACE is successfully finished, APDUs for testing can be
	  given
	  interactively

2010-04-13 21:06  frankmorgner

	* - completed mac verification. sm with pace is now fully
	  functional.
	  - made pace_test more fault tolerant.

2010-04-12 21:22  frankmorgner

	  changes of OpenPACE

2010-04-12 14:04  frankmorgner

	* bugfixes:
	  - sm.c: fixed mac data padding, when sending sm apdu without
	  data.
	  - pace.c: for iv calculation ecb is used instead of cbc
	  - pace.c: fixed ssc incrementation

2010-04-12 12:09  frankmorgner

	* - trying new apdu to reset retry counter in pace_test
	  - added pace wrapper for sm_transmit_apdu which automatically
	  increments the ssc

2010-04-12 10:31  frankmorgner

	* added missing include

2010-04-12 07:34  frankmorgner

	* added code for reading cardsecurity

2010-04-12 07:23  frankmorgner

	* - reverted changes from last commit

2010-04-12 07:18  frankmorgner

	* - added more debugging
	  - bugfix: header of sm apdu is authenticated instead of the
	  original apdu

2010-04-11 21:06  frankmorgner

	* bugfix: fetching unhandled error in update_iv

2010-04-11 20:49  frankmorgner

	* made bin_log more verbose

2010-04-11 20:31  frankmorgner

	* Bugfixes:
	  - ssc is a BIGNUM, since its size can be up to 16 bytes (not 16
	  bits as before)
	  - protected le is now encoded as octet string (not as unsigned
	  integer anymore)
	  - sc_format_asn1_entry was fet with wrong pointers (lebuf instead
	  of *lebuf
	  and formatted_data instead of *formatted_data
	  
	  Added some debug output.

2010-04-10 20:39  frankmorgner

	* made sm code independant from openssl

2010-04-10 18:16  frankmorgner

	* - pace.c: removed unused variable ssc
	  - pace.c: bugfix: don't increment ssc when resetting it.
	  - sm.c/.h: wrote wrapper sm_transmit_apdu
	  - sm.c: removed sm error handling, should be done by sc_check_sw
	  - sm.c/ccid.c/pace.c: added qualifier "static" to local functions

2010-04-10 17:00  frankmorgner

	* added sw checking for sm

2010-04-10 15:12  frankmorgner

	* added missing return buffer for select of CardSecurity

2010-04-10 14:53  frankmorgner

	* - sm.c (sm_encrypt) fixed header of sm apdu
	  - pace.c (EstablishPACEChannel) Fixed initialisation of
	  authentication_ctx.
	  (pace_test) Fixed usage of SC_TEST_RET and initialisation of
	  select apdu for
	  EF.CardSecurity.

2010-04-09 20:36  frankmorgner

	* - Work in progress: Almost finished (hopefully) flexible sm
	  implementation
	  (untested). struct sm_ctx needs external cipher and
	  authentication
	  implementations. Here only routines for
	  encryption/decryption/authentication
	  with PACE are given.

2010-04-01 05:52  frankmorgner

	* integrated SM into pace

2010-03-31 21:58  frankmorgner

	* - added untested function to decrypt sm
	  - function cipher now always disables automatic padding

2010-03-29 19:53  frankmorgner

	* - Added an untested SM implementation, currently only with
	  encryption
	  - Added utils from OpenPACE

2010-03-22 14:42  frankmorgner

	* adapted latest changes of OpenPACE

2010-03-15 18:34  frankmorgner

	* bugfix: corrected types of fields from ASN1_INTEGER to
	  ASN1_OCTET_STRING

2010-03-15 15:01  frankmorgner

	* - adopted the latest changes of OpenPACE
	  - bugfix: created receive buffer before sending general
	  authenticate apdus
	  - added more debug output

2010-03-10 09:14  frankmorgner

	* bugfix

2010-03-09 19:30  frankmorgner

	* using specifications from TR-03110 2.01 as default (as done by
	  test
	  cards)

2010-03-09 07:01  frankmorgner

	* bugfix: building with apdu.c apdu.h

2010-03-08 22:16  frankmorgner

	* - bugfix: general authenticate response data is now encapsulated
	  in a
	  dynamic data object
	  - added more debug messages
	  - bugfix: get_ef_card_access didn't fetch the whole file
	  - bugfix: set mse set at apdu type to case 3
	  - bugfix: only send the plain value (without tag/length) of the
	  PACE_MSE_SET_AT object
	  - bugfix: fixed general authenticate cla byte and set apdu type
	  to
	  case 4
	  - sanity checks in sc_transmit_apdu forbid the required apdu
	  format of
	  general authenticate so it had to be reimplemented in
	  my_transmit_apdu. apdu.c/apdu.h are mainly copied from opensc.

2010-03-05 22:35  frankmorgner

	* - fixed includes
	  - fixed return value from pace_test if NO_PACE is defined

2010-03-05 09:53  frankmorgner

	* - pace-testing is not done in threads anymore, program exits when
	  test is finished
	  - bugfix in debug_ossl
	  - more generic aproach to select EF.CardAccess
	  - EF.CardAccess is read sequencially, to get a correct send
	  sequence counter

2010-03-01 16:22  frankmorgner

	* - bugfix: moved ASN.1 declaration of PACE-APDUs to pace.c
	  - added commandline-option to test PACE currently with hard coded
	  secret etc.

2010-02-28 18:58  frankmorgner

	* Added support for Password Authenticated Connection Establishment
	  (PACE) using
	  OpenPACE (http://sourceforge.net/projects/openpace/). Since it is
	  currently
	  untested, it is disabled by default.

2010-01-31 15:57  frankmorgner

	* - implemented option parsing with getopt_long

2010-01-31 01:47  frankmorgner

	* - Some minor code improvements: catch and fix some rare errors,
	  taking more
	  usage of opensc debugging methods, removed not needed variables
	  and code
	  fragments

2010-01-30 11:52  frankmorgner

	* - fixed segmentation fault, ccid running stable now again

2010-01-30 02:43  frankmorgner

	* - switched to opensc's debugging function in log.h
	  - a segmentation fault of unknown origin crashes ccid after too
	  many
	  operations. last stable version is revision 29.

2010-01-30 00:04  frankmorgner

	* - created detect_card_presence to avoid limitations of
	  sc_detect_card_presence

2010-01-29 18:04  frankmorgner

	* - added functions for simplified debugging
	  - changed functions to pass pointers instead of structs and using
	  realloc
	  instead of malloc to reduce memory overhead/usage
	  - changed functions to return opensc-errors to pass
	  printout-debugging to the
	  top level
	  - included functionality of get_RDR_to_PC_Parameters in
	  perform_PC_to_RDR_GetParamters

2010-01-24 07:13  frankmorgner

	* added support for bNumberMessage

2010-01-23 22:45  frankmorgner

	* added support for flags in bConfirmPIN

2010-01-23 22:10  frankmorgner

	* added support for pin modification

2010-01-23 21:37  frankmorgner

	* - added defines for pin modification
	  - debugging apdu and rapdu there where they are created
	  - splitted pin block operations into several functions

2010-01-21 21:48  frankmorgner

	* - switched from libpcsc to libopensc. This brings some new
	  features:
	  - Support for 4 slots per reader
	  - abstraction of user interface
	  - interactive pin verification
	  - BCD encoding of PIN
	  - Support for new readers (OpenCT)
	  - automatically skip to a reader with a card
	  - added defines
	  - changed interface of ccid_initialize

2010-01-14 20:28  frankmorgner

	* removed not needed iso-identifier

2010-01-14 19:20  frankmorgner

	* code split into multiple files, added include guards

2010-01-12 10:06  frankmorgner

	* perform_PC_to_RDR_Secure works, read actual PIN is still missing

2010-01-10 23:09  frankmorgner

	* added support for pinpad. doesn't work atm, somehow abPINApdu is
	  wrong.

2010-01-05 18:44  frankmorgner

	* changed vendorid/productid, added new structures for future PIN
	  support.

2010-01-04 20:38  frankmorgner

	* Cleaned up warnings.

2010-01-04 19:48  frankmorgner

	* Separated bitbake recipes. vscarchitecture.bb simply collects the
	  other recipes now.

2009-08-06 20:25  schertz123456

	* Initial commit.
