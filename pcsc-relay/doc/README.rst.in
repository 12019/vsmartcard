Welcome to pcsc-relay. The purpose of pcsc-relay is to forward APDUs from the
OpenPICC or from a libnfc device to a smart card via the PCSC middleware. You
can use this program in combination with the virtual smart card to emulate a
ISO/IEC 14443 smart card.

pcsc-relay has the following dependencies:

- PC/SC middleware
- libnfc_

Hints on libnfc
---------------

pcsc-relay links against libnfc_. Here is an example of how to get the standard
installation of the latter::
 
    PREFIX=/tmp/install
    LIBNFC=libnfc
    svn co http://libnfc.googlecode.com/svn/trunk $LIBNFC
    cd $LIBNFC
    autoreconf -i
    ./configure --prefix=$PREFIX
    make
    make install

Building pcsc-relay with libnfc_ is done best using :command:`pkg-config`.  The file
:file:`libnfc.pc` should be located in ``$INSTALL/lib/pkgconfig``. Here is how to
configure pcsc-relay to use it::

    ./configure PKG_CONFIG_PATH=$PREFIX/lib/pkgconfig


-------------------------
Hints on PC/SC middleware
-------------------------

PC/SC is included by default in most modern operating systems. On Unix-like
systems (Linux, OS X, Sun OS) it is realized by PCSC-Lite_. To compile
pcsc-relay you will need to install the PCSC-Lite headers from your
distribution. Windows also ships with a PC/SC middleware in form of the
Winscard module. Microsoft's developement environment Visual Studio includes
all necessary data for building pcsc-relay.
