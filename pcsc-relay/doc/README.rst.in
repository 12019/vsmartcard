Welcome to @PACKAGE_NAME@. The purpose of @PACKAGE_NAME@ is to relay a smart
card using an contact-less interface. Currently the following contact-less
backends:

- libnfc_
- OpenPICC_

Command APDUs are received with the contact-less interface and forwarded to an
existing smart card via PC/SC. The Response APDUs are then sent back via RFID.
You can use @PACKAGE_NAME@ in combination with the :ref:`vicc` to completely
emulate an ISO/IEC 14443 smart card.

.. note::
    This software can actually be used in a relay attack allowing full access
    to the card. `We discussed the impact especially on the German identity
    card
    <http://media.ccc.de/browse/congress/2010/27c3-4297-de-die_gesamte_technik_ist_sicher.html>`_,
    but it generally concerns *all* contact-less smart cards.

@PACKAGE_NAME@ has the following dependencies:

- PC/SC middleware
- libnfc_

---------------
Hints on libnfc
---------------

@PACKAGE_NAME@ links against libnfc_. Here is an example of how to get the standard
installation of the latter::
 
    PREFIX=/tmp/install
    LIBNFC=libnfc
    svn co http://libnfc.googlecode.com/svn/trunk $LIBNFC
    cd $LIBNFC
    autoreconf -i
    ./configure --prefix=$PREFIX
    make
    make install

Building @PACKAGE_NAME@ with libnfc_ is done best using :command:`pkg-config`.  The file
:file:`libnfc.pc` should be located in ``$INSTALL/lib/pkgconfig``. Here is how to
configure @PACKAGE_NAME@ to use it::

    ./configure PKG_CONFIG_PATH=$PREFIX/lib/pkgconfig


-------------------------
Hints on PC/SC middleware
-------------------------

A PC/SC middleware is included by default in most modern operating systems. On
Unix-like systems (Linux, OS X, Sun OS) it is realized by PCSC-Lite_. To
compile @PACKAGE_NAME@ you will need to install the PCSC-Lite_ headers from
your distribution.

Windows also ships with a PC/SC middleware in form of the Winscard module.
Microsoft's developement environment Visual Studio includes all necessary data
for building @PACKAGE_NAME@.
