Welcome to virtualsmartcard. The purpose of virtualsmartcard is to emulate a
smartcard and make it accessible through PCSC. Currently the virtual smartcard
supports almost all commands of ISO-7816 including secure messaging. Besides a
plain ISO-7816 smartcard it is also possible to emulate a German ePass (only
basic access control) and a rudimentary Cryptoflex smartcard.

The virtual smartcard communicates with the virtual smartcard driver through a
socket on port 35963. The file utils.py was taken from Henryk Pl√∂tz's
cyberflex-shell.
