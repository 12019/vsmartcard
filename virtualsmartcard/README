Welcome to virtualsmartcard. The purpose of virtualsmartcard is to emulate a
smartcard and make it accessible through PCSC. Currently the virtual smartcard
supports almost all commands of ISO-7816 including secure messaging. Besides a
plain ISO-7816 smartcard it is also possible to emulate a German ePass (only
basic access control) and a rudimentary Cryptoflex smartcard.

The virtual smartcard communicates with the virtual smartcard driver through a
socket on port 35963. The file utils.py was taken from Henryk Pl√∂tz's
cyberflex-shell.


INSTALLATION
------------

See file INSTALL.


RUNNING virtualsmartcard
------------------------

First you need to make sure that pcscd loads the virtual smartcard driver. You
might run "update-reader.conf" to update pcscd's configuration file. Then
"pcscd -f -d" should say something like
readerfactory.c:1024:RFInitializeReader() Attempting startup of Virtual PCD 00 00 using /usr/lib/pcsc/drivers/serial/libvpcd.so

Now you can run "virtualsmartcard" which connects to the virtual reader. The
command "virtualsmartcard --help" gives an overview about the command line
options.

You should now be able to access the virtual smartcard through the system's
PC/SC API. You can use the opensc-explorer or pcsc_scan to test that.
