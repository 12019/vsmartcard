Welcome to virtualsmartcard. The purpose of virtualsmartcard is to emulate a
smart card and make it accessible through PCSC. Currently the virtual smart
card supports almost all commands of ISO-7816 including secure messaging.
Besides a plain ISO-7816 smart card it is also possible to emulate a German
ePass (only basic access control) and a rudimentary Cryptoflex smart card. The
virtual smart card can be accessed through the virtual smart card reader which
is a driver for pcscd of PCSC-Lite.

By default the virtual smart card communicates with the virtual smart card
reader through a socket on localhost port 35963. The file utils.py was taken
from `Henryk Pl√∂tz's cyberflex-shell <https://github.com/henryk/cyberflex-shell/>`_.


Installation
------------
::

    autoconf -vsi
    ./configure
    make
    make install


Running virtualsmartcard
------------------------

First you need to make sure that pcscd loads the virtual smart card driver. You
might run ``update-reader.conf`` to update pcscd's configuration file. Then
``pcscd -f -d`` should say something like
readerfactory.c:1024:RFInitializeReader() Attempting startup of Virtual PCD 00 00 using /usr/lib/pcsc/drivers/serial/libvpcd.so

Now you can run ``vicc`` which connects to the virtual reader. The
command ``vicc --help`` gives an overview about the command line
options.

You should now be able to access the virtual smart card through the system's
PC/SC API. You can use the opensc-explorer or pcsc_scan to test that.
